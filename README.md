# Thread Safety and Synchronization demonstration exercise for the Distributed Software Systems -course (DTEK2088)

This Java demonstration project was done as a part of the Distributed Software Systems course. It simulates a grading system where multiple reviewers grade student submissions concurrently.

Each task focuses on resolving synchronization issues, implementing proper locking, and preventing race conditions to maintain data consistency and system stability.

Each task is done separately and can also be run independently.

**The solutions** can be found [src/main/java/fi/utu/tech/](src/main/java/fi/utu/tech/) and are named respectively for each assignment. 

**The assignment details** are available in Finnish at [doc/tehtavananto.md](doc/tehtavananto.md).
